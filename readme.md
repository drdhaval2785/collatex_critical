# collatex-critical

Ever wondered how to prepare critical editions with multiple witnesses?
python-collatex provides a way to create collated XMLs, SVGs, HTMLs.
But they are centered around showing differences in columns.

For critical editors, the usual expectation is that the output should be in a PDF / markdown / HTML / latex file where the most frequent occurrence is shown in the main text and the variant readings of all other witnesses are duly noted in the footnote / endnote.

If you want to do just the same, you are in the correct place.
